        <h1>Wash Your Hands</h1>
        <p>Did you know, only 5% of people wash their hands properly3? That means, when you touch something others have touched, you're transferring all those germs to your belongings or even your face. Gross!
            <br>Hand washing, now more than ever, is important for keeping viruses, illnesses and COVID-19 at bay and staying healthy. And washing your hands is still the number one way to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in your community. If you cannot be socially distant or wear a mask, washing your hands is the best defense you have against this virus and spreading it to others. 
            <br>If you can't wash your hands right away, hand sanitizer is a great alternative. But look for hand sanitizer that has at least 60% alcohol. Those are the most effective at eliminating dangerous bacteria. Try carrying a hand sanitizer with you at all times or an emergency hand washing kit for those times you can't find soap and water. </p>
        <h2>When should you wash your hands?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>After blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing</li>
            <li>After touching your eyes, nose or mouth when in public</li>
            <li>After being in a public place</li>
            <li>Before and after caring for someone</li>
            <li>Before and after touching or removing your face covering</li>
            <li>After using the bathroom</li>
            <li>Before and after eating food</li>
            <li>After touching doorknobs and handles, buttons or public spaces</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The CDC recommends washing hands for at least 20 seconds to ensure you're removing all the germs from your hands. To make sure you're washing for the minimum amount of time, try humming these 20-second songs or verses to make the time go by.</p>

            <li>Happy Birthday (sing it twice)</li>
            <li>Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star</li>
