        <h1>Wash Your Hands</h1>
        <p>Did you know, only 5% of people wash their hands properly3? That means, when you touch something others have touched, you're transferring all those germs to your belongings or even your face. Gross!
            <br>Hand washing, now more than ever, is important for keeping viruses, illnesses and COVID-19 at bay and staying healthy. And washing your hands is still the number one way to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in your community. If you cannot be socially distant or wear a mask, washing your hands is the best defense you have against this virus and spreading it to others. 
            <br>If you can't wash your hands right away, hand sanitizer is a great alternative. But look for hand sanitizer that has at least 60% alcohol4. Those are the most effective at eliminating dangerous bacteria. Try carrying a hand sanitizer with you at all times or an emergency hand washing kit for those times you can't find soap and water. </p>
        <h2>When should you wash your hands?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>After blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing</li>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
        </ul>
