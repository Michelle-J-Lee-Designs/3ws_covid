            <p>Wearing a cloth face covering gives you protection from COVID-19, but it’s not enough on its own to keep you completely healthy. That’s why it’s important to follow the other steps when combating the spread of the virus.</p>
            <p>COVID-19 spreads easiest among people who are in close contact - within 6 feet - with each other for a long time. It spreads when someone sneezes, coughs, or talks. The virus can be spread into the air and into the mouths and noses of others around them – gross, right? </p>
            <p>Waiting at least 6 feet away from those around you in public or enclosed spaces is the easiest way to make sure you’re far enough away from these virus droplets. And it’s even more important for those who are high risk.

            <h2>Tips for social distancing</h2>
            <p>When you have to run errands, need to get outside for exercise, or just want to take a break from being at home, there are ways you can do it while still social distancing.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Plan your trip before you go!</strong> Make sure you know any guidelines that a location or business has</li>
                <li><strong>Only visit stores in-person for essentials</strong> like groceries, household items, medications, etc. Try curbside pickup, local delivery, or ship to home options for non-essentials</li>
                <li>If you are shopping in store, <strong>look for floor markings or guides</strong> to help you stay distant while performing more normal tasks</li>
                <li><strong>Get outside!</strong> It's easier and safer to social distance outdoors. Running, hiking, a day at the park or going for a neighborhood walk is a great way to get away from home while being distant from others</li>
                <li><strong>Know your own space.</strong> Sometimes we can get caught up in an activity and accidentally get to close to others, it happens. But now more than ever, it's important to know how close you are to others</li>
            </ul>
