        <h1>Wear a Mask</h1>
        <p>Did you know...a cough or sneeze from COVID-19 can travel up to 27 feet1! That's why it's important to put a barrier between you and others while in public. Social distancing is a great measure, but wearing a cloth face covering adds extra protection. 
            <br>The CDC recommends wearing a cloth face covering to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. Wearing a face covering in public places reduces not only your risk for getting COVID-19, but it also protects others around you – like high-risk people, essential workers, and older adults. 
            <br>Wearing a face covering while taking other steps to protect yourself – like handwashing and social distancing – is the easiest way to stay healthy during the COVID-19 pandemic.<br>*this information is adapted from the CDC.</p>
